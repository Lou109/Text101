  storyText: 'You have just been assigned for Zombie Zone mission certain death.

    All
    ready and equipt with gasmask, toxic biochemical protective clothing and a g420009
    machine gun.


    You need to decide which path to take in order to find the
    Laboratory.

    Which way should i go ?


    1. Down the long deserted road
    with lots of fields and rather unpleasant looking farm animals.

    2. Take
    the public foot path into a misty fog of toxic gas.'
