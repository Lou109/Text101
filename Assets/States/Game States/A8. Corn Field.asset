  storyText: 'The crops in this corn field look dead. Like the rest of this wretched
    place. You can see industrial buildings in the distance from here. So you head
    in the north east direction towards the farm gate.


    All of a sudden you
    hear an engine noise getting louder and louder. You cant see what it is due to
    the tall crops.


    Decisions decisions ...


    1. Jump up above the corn
    to see what it is.


    2. Run as fast as you can towards the farm.'
