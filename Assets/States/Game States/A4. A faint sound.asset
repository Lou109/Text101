  storyText: "This pathway is very narrow. Seems to be a lot of dead trees. There
    is a very unpleasant smell of rotting flesh coming from the ground. \n\nYou can
    hear a faint sound of dragging feet coming from around the corner.\n\nWhat are
    you going to do now ?\n\n1. Hide behind the largest tree in hope you don't get
    spotted by who or what ever it is.\n\n2. Make a hasty retreat across the fields"
